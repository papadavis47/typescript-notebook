# TypeScript Notebook

## This is a subheading component - written in MDX/Markdown.

This is a paragraph.

## The following is syntax highlighting:

```ts:src/main.ts

import { MyComponent } from '@/components/Supercool'

funcion add(num1: number, num2: number): number {
	return num1 + num2
}

```

So this is where I can write some more.

And some more here.

And here is some more text.

**Bold text here**

_And italic text here_
